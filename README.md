# Google bias analysis with spaCy

## spaCy
spaCy is a free, open-source library for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python.  

https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101


## Motivation
[Googleâ€™s algorithms discriminate against women and people of colour](https://theconversation.com/googles-algorithms-discriminate-against-women-and-people-of-colour-112516)  
or 
[plan to exterminate the White race](https://atadria.github.io/Google-bias-with-spaCy/)?  

We will try to check why Google's image search results
for the query 'happy white woman' differ from other search engines. 
We will use results from Bing for comparison. 
Results are limited by dates from 2010-01-01 to 2019-01-01.
